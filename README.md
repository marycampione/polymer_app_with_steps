polymer_app_with_steps
======================

This is a version of the example at https://github.com/marycampione/polymer_paper_example and/or it's derivative https://github.com/marycampione/dartier-polymer-paper



Two other versions are available:

* A version that is a straight translation of the PolymerJS tutorial, which you can find here: https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/tutorial/intro.html.
* A version that uses more Dart constructs that the straight translation:  https://github.com/marycampione/dartier-polymer-paper

Have fun!
